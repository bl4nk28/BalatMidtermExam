        <h3> Santa Rosa City: Two Hundred Twenty-Six Years of History</h3>

        <p>A brief historical perspective of Santa Rosa City is provided in order to trace the whole spectrum of its development 
            that in turn can serve as a useful guide in the current planning exercise being conducted for the city. q
            The temporal narrative will provide a picture of the direction being experienced by the city that will inform planners 
            what interventions need to be taken that will lead the city towards a more sustainable form of development. In this narrative, 
            the city’s history is traced through the following periods of its existence: From Barrio Bukol, Revolutionary Period,
            American Period, Sakdalista Revolt Period, 
            Japanese Period and Post-War Period. A detailed list of local chief executives and periods served is 
            provided at the end of this chapter.</p>

        <p>From Barrio Bukol</p>

          <p>When the Spanish conquistador Juan de Salcedo, grandson of Miguel Lopez de Legaspi, 
            explored the wide span of the Laguna Lake during the early period, 
            he discovered the settlements of native people along the coastal areas – in particular the area of “Tabuco”, 
            that covered what are now the nearby towns of Cabuyao and Biñan. 
            Santa Rosa was then a territorial extension of Biñan called Barrio Bukol – an area presumably 
            referring to the sloping and elevated western section of the town.</p>

        <p>The land is part of the Hacienda Biñan, the center of vast tracks of land in Laguna owned by the Dominicans, 
            the famed Order of Preachers (OP), as early as 1644. According to stories,
            a kapilya or chapel was erected by the Dominicans friars in 1757.
            During the period also, the Historical Cuartel de Santo Domingo, a bastion of the Spanish Civil Guards,
            was established near the boundary with Silang Cavite to guard and protect the lowland residents from the tulisanes or bandits \
            that roam and cross from the province of Cavite to the province of Laguna. During the Spanish revolution, reinforcements 
            against Philippine revolutionaries were stationed in this eight-hectare headquarters.</p>

        <p>
            Barrio Bukol was already an established settlement in Biñan spread over various sitios such as Makinang Apoy,
             Tagapo, Pulong Santa Cruz, Aplaya and Caingin, among others. Similar to the “encomienda system” of the Spaniards, 
             a hacienda situated in the Poblacion area was established. A native woman of the barrio named Doña Juana Galintang owned 
             several hectares of grassland and her status in the community was duly recognized by naming the plaza after her.Barrio Bukol was
